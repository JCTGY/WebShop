* [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development


### Server - Backend

* 	[JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Javaâ„¢ Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit
* 	[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Framework to ease the bootstrapping and development of new Spring Applications

### Libraries
* [JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) - This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies
* [Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html) - Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application
* [Validation](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) - Make sure data is valid before REST api call
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder
